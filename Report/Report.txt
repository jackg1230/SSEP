What was accomplished:
Based on Rowans EDR:
We have created a full-stack application which allows users to login/register, 
view items currently on offer within our homepage and information about them such as the current offer, a description of the item and the price of the item.
Users can directly add items from the homepage to their shopping basket or they can navigate to different tabs;
such as the search tab where users can search for all products within the database and find out information about them and add them to their basket. 
Users can view and edit their basket and view the total basket for all members of their house including a total price.
Users can also select a date for delivery and edit their basket to be private within the settings page.
We have implemented a database which at the start of each day pings the Supermarket API and gets an update on all product information such as stock levels and offers. 
Our Database also stores information about each user, such as the items in their trolley, the house which they are a part of, their username and password,
personal settings and the date for their scheduled delivery.

How this was accomplished:
Regular Team meetings on discord across the project timeline (2x a week). The group worked to establish who would focus on each part of the prototype in line with Rowan's EDR.
We used paint to draw mock webpages for our design which can be found within the Supporting_material folder. Roles were divided based on strengths, Rowan and Jack worked on backend 
development whereas Lucas and Ethan worked on the frontend. Allowing for parallel development.
Jack & Rowan 400words for backend & search page (can't remember who developed that page)
Lucas 200 words for homepage and groupOrderPage
Ethan 200 words for settings & Delivery date system
