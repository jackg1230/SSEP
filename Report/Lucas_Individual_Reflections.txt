Jack:
Jack has made significant contributions to the project, particularly in the sheer volume of work completed. His work ethic was evident throughout, 
and he consistently ensured the project stayed on track. 
The backend of completed extremely quickly and efficiently which allowed frontend development to be focused on 
and worked on without any delays waiting for backend development. 
Jack's willingness to help and share knowledge with the team improved the speed at which 
we were able to complete this project greatly. 
He was especially supportive in teaching me how to communicate effectively with the backend from the frontend of the application. 
His ability to explain complex concepts in a clear and approachable way not only helped me personally but also strengthened the team’s overall productivity. 
Another strength of Jack’s was his availability and excellent communication. Throughout the project, whenever anybody had any questions or needed assistance, 
he was readily available and provided prompt, thoughtful responses. This responsiveness created a collaborative and efficient working dynamic, 
which was crucial to the project's success. 
That said, one area where Jack could further enhance his already impressive contributions is by including more comments in his code. 
While his technical work is highly effective, additional comments would improve the code clarity and readability. 
This would be particularly helpful for team members who may need to build upon or troubleshoot his code in the future. 
By making his code more accessible through clear documentation, he could further strengthen the team’s ability to collaborate effectively.

Rowan:
Rowan has been a very approachable member of the team, which made working on this project a pleasant and collaborative experience. 
He always demonstrates a strong commitment to the project by writing substantial amounts of code and dedicating lots of time to debugging and fixing errors, 
not only in his own work but also in mine which saved me lots of time struggling to fix parts of my code which I didn’t quite understand how to fix. 
This level of dedication ensured the project progressed smoothly and helped maintain high-quality code. 
Rowan provided the Engineering Design Review (EDR) for the project. This was a crucial part of our system design, 
when any member of the team struggled to figure out how to implement part of the EDR 
Rowan was very willing to explain how different parts of the system should be implemented 
was incredibly helpful. His clear guidance helped me better understand the structure and logic of the application, allowing for better teamwork. 
Rowan’s coding skills were impressive, and the code he produced was effective and well thought out. 
However, one area for potential improvement would be the inclusion of additional comments in his code. 
More detailed documentation would make the code easier for others to understand and troubleshoot if necessary. 
Toward the end of the project, Rowan’s availability decreased, which understandably happens sometimes. 
However, this did make contacting him a bit more challenging during the final stages. 
Improved availability during critical phases could help ensure smoother collaboration and quicker resolutions to last-minute issues.

Ethan:
Ethan made some notable contributions to the project, 
particularly in the organisation of our initial meeting and the efficient code he wrote for the delivery date scheduling system. 
This functionality was a key part of our application, and Ethan’s ability to implement it effectively and quickly was a significant asset to the team. 
Additionally, he was approachable and helpful when it came to writing the documentation for the project. 
His willingness to assist with this task ensured that our work was well-documented and aligned with the project requirements. 
Ethan’s availability was quite limited during the earlier stages of the project. While he helped organise the first meeting, 
his reduced involvement afterward made it quite challenging to coordinate efforts and maintain momentum in the early phases. 
This was particularly noticeable as the team worked to define our workflow and divide responsibilities, 
without Ethans help at this stage we had to work harder on the frontend to ensure we didn’t fall behind schedule. 
However, Ethan’s engagement improved significantly toward the end of the project. During this important phase, 
he stepped up to contribute additional code implementations and provided valuable support with documentation. 
This late-stage involvement was much appreciated and helped the team finalise key aspects of the project in time for completion. 
Moving forward, maintaining more consistent availability throughout the entire project lifecycle would make collaboration more seamless and productive. 
Ethan’s technical skills and contributions were valuable, and with greater participation earlier on, 
his impact on the project could have been even more significant.
