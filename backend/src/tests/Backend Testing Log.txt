Implement Database on server:
	Test to be ran:
		Connect to postgres database on port 5432
		sample query to select users
		sample query to add to trolley
	All Tests Passed

Implement program to update database from shops:
	Tests to be ran:
		Check file runs without errors
		Check to see if correct items have been added to database
		Check connection is closed correctly
	Products are not fetched from actual supermarket website but from a sample selection 	of Json files due to the implication of web scraping and lack of API's
 
Implemented Node API to process requests targeted to the database:
	Tests to be ran:
		Ensure the current version of node is installed - Failed - Node package was then updated 
		Run sample query on Node server to ensure correct connection with database
		Ensure port 3000 is open to allow communication with server
	All Tests passed after minor change


I will be using the curl Linux command to test the output of the api
	UPDATE - Had to add the -K modifier to the curl command due to insecure connection to http server
	Create a basic user API which fetches the email of all users when called - PASS
	Create an API that returns the product table in its entirety, allowing it to be displayed on the product page - PASSED
	For Lucas product page - Create an API that returns the information of all products that currently have discounts on - PASSED 

THUS FAR - all test passed ensuring home page and search page are operating as intended - Aiming to complete login and adding to trolley in the next iteration.
CONTINUATION - I will be creating a login API that returns a user_id, house_id and public_trolley when an email and password are entered
	Tests to be ran:
		Can email be entered? - PASS
		Are invalid emails caught client side? - PASS
		Are the correct details returned? - PASS
		Are users informed if incorrect details are entered - PASS
		Are users informed if username and or password is wrong - FAIL
	in Hindsight we decided that accounts would be more secure if the user was unaware whether it was the username or password which was incorrect

Establish ability to add items to trolley 
	Tests:
		Use Curl to test API, artificially adding items to the trolley
		Use React page to add items to the trolley and ensure they can be viewed in the database
	ALL TESTS PASSED
