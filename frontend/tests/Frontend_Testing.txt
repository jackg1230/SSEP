Frontend Testing Log:
Implemented all webpages at a basic level & a header to navigate between them.
	Tests to be run:
		Navigate to homepage
		Navigate to search page
		Navigate to order/group order page
		Navigate to settings page
	All tests passed.
Implemented Homepage Table.
	Tests to be run:
		See if all products on offer can be viewed
		Can products be added to a user's basket
	All products on offer can be viewed, but products cannot be added to the users basket as no login system implemented yet so there is no userID to assign the product to.
Implemented login system.
	Tests to be run:
		Can a user log in
		Can a new user register an account & join a house
	User can login and access the homepage correctly
	No way to create a new account or join a house yet
Users can now add items to their basket from the homepage

Implemented search page table
	Tests to be run:
		Can a user access different items in the database e.g. apples, tomatoes, potatoes
		Can a user add items to their basket
	Multiple items can be accessed and also added to a users basket.
Implemented Individual basket
	Tests to be run:
		Can a user increase the number of a certain product within the basket
		Can a user decrease the number of a certain product within the basket
		Can a user delete a certain product within the basket, by setting its quantity to 0
	Products can be deleted without issue. Current implementation allows users to increment or decrement the value of items in the basket however, due to backend implementation each time the number is edited a new row is created in the table of the same product.
Implemented Group basket:
	Tests to be run:
		A user should not be able to increase/decrease/delete the number of a certain product which another user has added
		A user's trolley who has their public trolley attribute in the database set to False should not be displayed in other user's group trolley
